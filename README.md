# Insurance-Preduction-using-Logistic-Regression
In this case study, the focus is on predicting insurance purchase decisions using logistic regression. The initial phase involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to uncover insights and relationships among variables. Logistic regression modeling is then employed to establish a predictive relationship between features and insurance buying behavior. To ensure model reliability, Variable Inflation Factor (VIF) assessment is carried out, mitigating multicollinearity concerns and enhancing the accuracy of the predictive outcomes.
